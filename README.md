> **Bumper** is a self-hosted central server for Ecovacs vacuum robots.
> It replaces the Ecovacs cloud, giving you full local control through a privacy-first,
> high-performance stack: Python + uv, Docker Swarm, and NGINX.

![Web-UI Preview](docs/images/web-ui.png)

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Self-Hosted**: Operate without Ecovacs cloud servers.
- **Privacy-First**: All data stays within your network.
- **High Performance**: Built on Python 3.13.x with [uv](https://pypi.org/project/uv/) for efficient async I/O.
- **Docker Swarm & Compose**: One-command startup with turnkey NGINX configuration.
- **Modular**: Easily extend protocols and add integrations.

> **⚠️ Warning**: Branches `main`/`dev` are under active development and may be unstable. Use at your own risk.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Prepare TLS certificates and minimal environment variables before any deployment:

**TLS certificates**:

Place your certs in `certs/ca.crt`, `certs/bumper.crt`, `certs/bumper.key`, or generate them:

```sh
$./scripts/create-cert.sh
```

**Environment variables**:

Create a `.env` file with at least the following:

```env
NETWORK_MODE=overlay        # by default "bridge"

# Needs to be set when running with Docker; default is auto-detected from socket
BUMPER_ANNOUNCE_IP=192.168.0.100  # your server's public/local IP
```

Full configuration options are available in the [Wiki](https://MVladislav.github.io/bumper/infos/Env_Var/).

### ✨ Docker Swarm Deployment

**Step 1 – Clone the repository**

```sh
$git clone https://github.com/MVladislav/bumper.git
$cd bumper
```

```sh
$docker-swarm-compose deebot      # alias for Docker Swarm Compose
# or
$docker-compose up -d             # standard Docker Compose
```

**Step 3 – Open the UI**

Visit `https://ecovacs.net/` in your browser.
